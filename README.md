# :memo: About the Project

This application is a boilerplate for complex and large systems, especially those that need to scale with security and code quality.

We sought to achieve 3 pillars: readability, reusability, and refactorability.

In the construction of the UI, the Atomic Design structure was chosen, organizing the global components into atoms, molecules, organisms and templates.

In addition to being constantly updated, this project was configured in the smallest details to serve as a basis for professional projects that require standardized and easy-to-maintain code architecture and design.

# :rotating_light: Important Considerations

- The husky is configured to not allow commit if there are any lint and typescript errors. The push can only be done if all tests and builds (of the project and the storybook) pass.

- Due to husky's build check settings, to push with git, the development server must be stopped first or an error will occur in the `git push` command.

- Some conventions widely used in the React ecosystem were used. For example:

  - In the root of the components folder, an export index was created to facilitate the use of components with named import. In this way, to use a component, just import it as an object and use it with the prefix "C", thus avoiding several unnecessary lines of imports:

    ```jsx
    import * as C from 'ui/components'

    ...
    <C.Card>
      <C.Input />
    </C.Card>
    ...
    ```

  - To import style sheets that use styled-components, named imports were used for the same reason as before, thus:

    ```jsx
    import * as S from './styles'

    ...
    <S.Wrapper>
      <S.Title />
    </S.Wrapper>
    ...
    ```

- To create a complete component folder with tests, storybook, index and styles files, just use the command in the terminal: `yarn generate`
